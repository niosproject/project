<p>The National Institute of Open Schooling formerly known as National Open
 School (NOS) was established in November, 1989, as an autonomous
 organization in pursuance of National Policy on Education,1989 by the 
Ministry of Human Resource Developement, Goct. of India. Open Schooling
was originally experimented upon since 1978 as a project of the CBSE and was
later amalgamated with NIOS. It is partly funded by Government of India,
keeping in view the need of the target groups, the NIOS is also providing a 
number of vocational and community oriented courses besides general and
academic courses.</p>
